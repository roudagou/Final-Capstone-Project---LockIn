Story: 4/5
Addresses universal productivity challenges: procrastination, distractions, poor time management Clear value proposition backed by 25+ years of Pomodoro Technique research Appeals to broad audience: students cramming for exams, professionals managing deadlines, remote workers maintaining focus Personal productivity improvement creates immediate, measurable impact on users' daily lives Transforms overwhelming task lists into manageable, focused work sessions
Market: 4/5
Large potential user base spanning students, professionals, freelancers, and remote workers Growing $4.2B+ productivity app market with consistent year-over-year growth Established Pomodoro technique community provides built-in user awareness Appeals to wellness-conscious users seeking work-life balance Targets individuals with ADHD/focus challenges (expanding market with growing awareness) Opportunity to differentiate from existing competitors through superior mobile experience
Habit: 5/5
Designed for multiple daily usage sessions (average user completes 4-8 pomodoros per day) Users actively create and curate their own tasks, projects, and goals Streak tracking and daily statistics create compelling motivation loops Session completion provides regular positive reinforcement and sense of achievement Becomes deeply integrated into user's essential work routine and time management system Break reminders ensure consistent app engagement throughout the workday
Scope: 4/5
Core MVP is clearly defined and technically achievable within development timeline Essential features use standard iOS frameworks (Timer, UserNotifications, Core Data, AVAudioPlayer) Can launch with basic timer + task management and expand incrementally Stripped-down version (basic Pomodoro timer with simple task list) still provides significant value Well-understood technical requirements with clear implementation roadmap Complexity manageable through phased feature rollout and modular architecture
